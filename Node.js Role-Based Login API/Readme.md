# Project README

Welcome to our awesome project! Below are some handy commands to help you get started and maintain a clean and organized codebase.

## Getting Started

To start the server, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will kick off the server and get your project up and running.

## Code Formatting

We care about consistent and beautiful code. Use the following command to run Prettier:

```bash
npm run format
```

This will ensure your code follows our style guidelines.

## Linting

To check for linting errors and maintain code quality, use:

```bash
npm run lint
```

If you want to automatically fix fixable issues, use:

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

This command will attempt to automatically fix any issues that can be resolved programmatically.

## Environment Variables

Don't forget to set up your environment variables! Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your configuration details there.

Example `.env` file:

```
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase
API_KEY=yourapikey
```
